Version 0.1.5 decays bayesian weights toward mostly prediction of each child based on the other 2 childs, for each of 3 childs. The hard-coded brainwave is barely seen and an imagined brainwave crawls like an inchworm, stretching its green center which matches the green hard-coded brainwave. This appears to be the result of a kind of physics in the equations of how brainwaves flow and stretch. Its starting to look like an artificial intelligence's dream, but we won't get into that much until many people connect to eachother through it on the Internet.
